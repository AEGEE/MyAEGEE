Remember that the (default silly) password is in init.sql (read below)
---
you hve to run:

 ./helper.sh -v --execute statuspage /bin/sh


and in there:

php artisan cachet:install

before using it for the first time. This ONLY if the db isn;t initialised already
(which it is). NOTE: the apikey for the user admin must be changed! and of course the pw, the usual "5ecr3t"
---
also the user of the environment file that is going to be mounted
must be 82

chown 82 <filename>
