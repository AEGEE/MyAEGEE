## General

The discounts module of MyAEGEE is responsible for distributing discount codes (Flixbus, N26 etc.);

## Contributing

The main developer of this module is Sergey Peshkov (AEGEE-Voronezh, github.com/serge1peshcoff). If you want to contribute, keep in mind these points:
- consider following the code style (run `npm run lint` to check if your changes matches the code style)
- if you are implementing new features, consider writing tests for them
- if you are changing existing stuff, consider not breaking the tests :D

## Technology stack

- Node.js
- Express
- PostgreSQL + Sequelize as ORM
